## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the vignette to username and password instead of PAT since the public server is regularly updated 


* I have tested the package on GITHUB actions and all past using these OSs
   - {os: macos-latest,   r: 'release'}
   - {os: windows-latest, r: 'release'}
   - {os: ubuntu-latest,   r: 'devel', http-user-agent: 'release'}
   - {os: ubuntu-latest,   r: 'release'}
   - {os: ubuntu-latest,   r: 'oldrel-1'}
